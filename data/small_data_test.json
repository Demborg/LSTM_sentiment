Pei Wei (pronounced pay way I confirmed haha) is pretty darn good. we got a few things to share. I had the Asian chicken salad and was impressed! There was a decent amount of chicken. Some more veggies would be nice, but overall pretty good. The steak teriyaki was great as well as the fried rice. Over all good was good! Nice, clean, and reasonable.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

When we lived in California, I heard the place was shut down.  Glad to move back and see it open.  \n\nTake out rocks, call ahead.  They remember your phone number and name, so when you call they already know you.  They also save your last order to ask if you want the same, or to add anything to it... Nice touch.  I think I eat there too much! \n\nThe only thing I don't like, and I think I'm the only one who doesn't like it, is the soda machine.  Only because I always get a soda after someone has pumped out some nasty combination of orange soda and root beer, then I can taste it in my coke.  Wish they had some filter system.  Otherwise, I could eat here daily.  Find me here at least once a week! :)","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

There, bad restaurants expire in less that a year.  Pei Wei wouldn't last very long.  We had the Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao chicken.  The beef was in a salty, sticky sweet brown sauce that rendered it almost inedible.  The Chicken had little spice or sauce, although the pea pods were fresh.  Think Panda Express. Food is not serve family style. Food is ordered at the register and brought (eventually) to your table.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

If you like the tofu dishes at PF Chang's, you'll love Pei Wei. The food here is great. The service is exceptional. And the portions are huge! I usually end up taking about half the food home with me. Also, compared to other lunch spots near by (like Paradise Bakery), it's really not all that busy. Of course, it's not authentic Asian food, but you shouldn't be expecting that when you come here anyway.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Came at 6:30 and it wasn't busy but filled up by the time we left. The crowd was definitely older, I don't think I saw anyone under 30 in there. Decor was very woodsy and rustic. But at the end of the day, it's the food that counts!\nWe had...\nHot balls: lamb risotto, mushroom and fontina risotto, and a goat cheese and honey balls. You get three little timbit sized balls for 7 bucks which I thought was very reasonable. They were so delicious, I wished we had gotten the double portion after we were finished.\nPolenta w\/ Sausage Sugo: My affection for polenta knows no bounds so I loved every little spoonful of this. It came out on a slice of a tree trunk which allowed the polenta to slowly spread out perfectly over the dish. Polenta was creamy and had a nice umami flavour. Good liquid-to-polenta ratio made this comforting and incredibly addictive. Chef came out and laid the hot sausage meat sauce right on top of it. We loved it so much, we made it at home the next day...seriously.\nSteak tartare w\/ frites and salad: Delish and flavourful tartare. The frites were incredible!! Get them!\n\nWill I be back? Yes! None of the dishes even remotely disappointed me and the service was solid.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}
