The location of this hotel and very decent price makes this an amazing deal. When you walk out the front door Scott Monument and Princes street are right in front of you, Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile is a 2 minute walk via a close right around the corner, and there are so many hidden gems nearby including Calton Hill and the newly opened Arches that made this location incredible.\n\nThe hotel itself was also very nice with a reasonably priced bar, very considerate staff, and small but comfortable rooms with excellent bathrooms and showers. Only two minor complaints are no telephones in room for room service (not a huge deal for us) and no AC in the room, but they have huge windows which can be fully opened. The staff were incredible though, letting us borrow umbrellas for the rain, giving us maps and directions, and also when we had lost our only UK adapter for charging our phones gave us a very fancy one for free.\n\nI would highly recommend this hotel to friends, and when I return to Edinburgh (which I most definitely will) I will be staying here without any hesitation.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Von diesem hier waren wir nach dem überraschend positiven Erlebnis im Motel One an der Princes Street [1] etwas enttäuscht.\n\nDas Hotel ist wesentlich größer und extrem unübersichtlich. Da man auf der fünften Etage noch Teile eines weiteren Gebäude, das mittels einer Glasbrücke mit dem Hauptgebäude verbunden ist, hinzugenommen hat, kann die Suche nach dem Zimmer insbesondere auf dieser Etage zu einem Gang im Labyrinth ausarten. Habe ich so noch in keinem Hotel erlebt - uns begegneten immer wieder Menschen, die sich auf der Suche nach ihren Zimmern verirrt haben.\nUnser Zimmer war ähnlich aufgebaut wie das Zimmer im Motel One Princes Street - befand sich jedoch im Inneren des Gebäudes und hatte daher kein Fenster. Nur eine kleine Dachluke, die sich am oberen Ende eines etwa 3m langen Schachts befand, sorgte für einen minimalen Anteil Tageslicht im Zimmer. diese Luke ließ sich auch nicht öffnen, nur ein elektrisches Rollo ließ sich mittels eines Schalters öffnen bzw. schließen.\nSonst gilt für das Zimmer eigentlich das Gleiche wie für das Zimmer im im Motel One Princes Street: Relativ klein, trotzdem extrem ansprechend und schick gestaltet und clever durchdacht. Dazu sehr ruhig.\n\nIm gesamten Hotel gibt es kostenloses WLAN für die Dauer des Aufenthalts für maximal 3 Geräte.\n\nDie Lage des Motel One Royal Mile ist großartig. Vom Airlink-Flughafenbus kann man quasi in den Hoteleingang stolpern, es sind maximal 50m. Zur Royal Mile sind es etwa 100m Luftlinie (bergauf) und man benötigt etwa 5 Minuten bis dort.\n\nDas Frühstück für 9,50 GBP \/ Person kann man nutzen - muss man aber nicht. Es ist eher übersichtlich und kontinetaler Prägung, trotzdem aber sehr gut. Für den gleichen Preis oder weniger bekommt man aber problemlos ein reichhaltiges Frühstück in einem der zahlreichen Cafes von Edinburgh.\n\nFür ein oder zwei Nächte kann man hier problemlos bleiben, sollte aber nicht allzuviel erwarten. Hat man die Wahl, sollte man meiner Erfahrung nach lieber auf das andere Motel One an der Princes Street ausweichen. \n\n\n----\n[1] http:\/\/www.yelp.de\/biz\/motel-one-edinburgh-2?hrid=7UDwl3s_DuOokkGPZXZgBw","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This chain is spreading fast over there and they're bringing their efficiency and attention to detail with them here. \n\nMotel One is, as the name suggests, aimed at the budget market. Rates for this venue range from approximately £69\/night up. I booked ahead and appreciated the completely free reservation process with room guaranteed until 6pm on the day of arrival. If you give your credit card details, it's reserved beyond that time.\n\nLocation is excellent! If you exit from the Market St side of Waverly and turn right it's maybe 3 minutes away. It would be very hard to have it closer. That also makes it very close to the castle and Princes St. Welcome was warm and check-in easy. The lobby area is pretty small but clean and cosy with sweets, maps etc. There's a bar area down a few steps where they also serve the buffet breakfast each morning.\n\nMy room was the cheapest version and was internal, facing onto a courtyard. It had no view and was quite dark, but quiet. Everything was completely spotless. The bathroom was small but well designed and had a great shower. Bed was comfy with 2 single duvets. So continental, don't you know? I appreciated the tea and coffee making facilities (I'm like a beast without them), the decent sized TV and the free wifi. The hanging storage facilities are limited but it was fine for a few days. \n\nRandom: hands down the best hotel hairdryer I have ever used.

One of her brothers friends used to be a manager of one in Colorado too.  Tonight we decided to try it out.\n\nI placed my order online.  Easy process.  My wife went with an order of Chicken Lo Mein and I went with Sesame Chicken\/Steak with fried rice as well as an egg roll and 2 pot stickers.  Total for everything was $24.80 after tax.  I drove down and picked up my food.  The manager their was friendly, rang me up real quick and I was out the door in no time. This bag was heavy as hell too!   Here is how everything tasted.....................\n\nChicken Lo Mein-  Only had a little of this.  Good noodles, good white meat chicken.  My wife liked it.\n\nSesame Chicken\/Steak-  I decided to try out 2 kinds of meat.  They let you mix and match which is cool...they charge you for the highest priced item.  I substituted fried rice for white rice (.99 cents extra).  This was touted as soy citrus glaze, red bell peppers, onions, scallions, ginger, garlic and chile paste and sesame seeds.  It was just alright.  The flavors didn't really do much for me.  It was a tad spicy from the chile paste but overall it was kind of bland.  I had some pieces of steak\/chicken that were a bit funky too.  I would definitely try out a different dish next time here...if there is a next time ;-).  The fried rice was good!\n\nEgg Roll- Eh.  It was an egg roll.  Nothing fantastic about it but it tasted fine.  It came with a sweet mustard dipping sauce which was pretty tasty.  Usual fillings of pork, veggies etc.\n\nDeep Fried Pot Stickers-  I got 2 of these things.  They were good.  Small but good.  Straight pork filling in the middle of them.  \n\nOverall it was just alright.  I will say that they give you a GRIP of food.  The 2 entrees we got could have easily fed 1-2 more people.  For $24.80 it was a great value.  The food just wasn't the type of thing that  you would ever crave and keep you coming back though.  While I was eating my meal, all I could think of were better Chinese food places I have had before....wishing I was eating them instead.  It filled my belly, service was friendly and the value is definitely there.  I'll probably give them another try and order some other dishes to see if there is something I really like.

Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers. \n\nWith Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad, huh?","useful":8,"funny":4,"cool":6}

There's a long and interesting story surrounding Pei Wei and that of PF Changs. Let me just say that, a man named Paul Fleming (PF) and (Flemings) is responsible for many of the restaurants that you and I frequent. His ex wife and him went through a bitter divorce her nickname is (Flow) and she operates \"Flows,\" Chinese restaurants. Flow is Chinese and married another Caucasian man 20-25 years younger than her, who speaks fluent Chinese. Anyways, Peiwei's in my opinion is overpriced for the small amount of you receive for the consideration you give. In other words, there's no value for your consideration. Yes, I do enjoy the PeiWei Spicy chicken, extra spicy with water chestnuts, but at $12.53 for the water chestnuts and extra chicken, it's just not worth it. The rice is almost always dry and is cooked incorrectly in massive amounts, as well as being a long grain, not short grain rice. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":3}

The crab wontons are usually a sure bet at any Asian restaurant but for some reason it just always sucks ass here. Fishy weird taste that's contrary to what they should taste like and the sauce is garbage. Teriyaki Chicken was bland and shitty. Pei Wei Spicy dish was average at best only cuz of the sweet sugary sauce that masks the overall flavor. Now my girlfriend and I just feel like shit.. Why? Cuz it's shitty food. Also saw on the local news that the location on Glendale and 7th st. had 4 health code violations. I'm officially done with this place.

The latter was pretty good, though I found the enchilada a little perplexing.  It was hiding under the sauce and I couldn't really tell what was in it.    \n\nThe chips and salsa were great, though.  And hot.  The one person at our table who can apparently drink tabasco sauce straight even admitted his eyes were watering a little.  Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their meals.  \n\nI'm not in Ohio much, but I'd happily go back and try something else.  Oh, and um, I wouldn't exactly object to painting my living room lime green, after seeing how cool it looked at Don's.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Spinach salad came nicely dressed though the dressing was plain could have used more tartness. I had a few slight issues with the steak frites, the steak came closer to medium when medium rare was requested and was under seasoned. My accompaniment of frites (which were wonderful btw) on the other hand was too liberally salted with kosher salt so I guess I got the best of both worlds! The Bearnaise sauce sauce on the side was so-so and didn't do too much to perk up the steak.

(one thing has nothing to do with the other should you be saying to yourself something along the lines of \"well then what the hell is he complaining about\").\n\nthe vegetables that came on separate plates alongside the sandwiches were  4 dollars each.  we had three kinds.  one was sweet potatoes dressed with chilies, toasted coriander, mint and olive oil.  another was called farro, an ancient tuscan grain dressed with extra virgin olive oil, cucumber, carrot, and fine herbs. and the last one was chickpea salad with celery, pickled red onions, rosemary, parsley and lemon.\n\ni enjoyed all of them, but they were honestly not representative of their ingredients.  i dont need to have my dishes overpowered by their listed ingredients, but if something says its going to be flavoured by mint, fine herbs and lemon dont you think you should be able to experience that as you taste it?  i think so.  again, to reiterate, i didnt mind the natural taste of the vegetable offered, but if thats the way it will end up tasting, perhaps you should say so.\n\nall my peeves aside, i am still interested in trying this place out for dinner; the feel of the place is great, cool and relaxing and as i looked at their dinner menu it looked quite tasty.  so perhaps once they get their groove on itll be more enjoyable.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Everyone stopped talking at one point, they we're too busy eating.\n\nWe had a cake of our own brought in, so we got to take the dessert from the menu home.

The host and the servers are not snobby and seem fairly friendly in this Leslieville establishment. The patrons are mixed with both young and hip city dwellers along with older more experienced foodies dining out with other couples of the same.\n\nI found myself here ordering the much touted \"Hot Balls\" but found it just okay. The only hot ball that really stood out was the Goat Cheese with a honey like dipping sauce. It was actually a pretty amazing piece of creation. The other appetizer we have were the \"Diver Scallops\" which were cooked to perfection and came with a side of really thick and salty bacon. Our mains were the \"Leg of Lamb\" and \"Wild Stripped Bass\" both were great entrees that did not disappoint but at the same time didn't have a great WOW factor.  Desert was a bit of a disappointment, not much of a variety, you had a choice between chocolate, chocolate, or chocolate in some form or another. We had the homemade chocolate cheesecake, which really didn't amount to much for my taste buds. \n\nThe Wine list is very French and if you're going by the bottle they don't really have an inexpensive alternative. Every bottle is $50+ which can make for a very expensive meal. \n\nOverall the food experience was just okay with some ups and downs. But the real down of the night was the service, after sitting down to our table , it took literally 10 min for someone to show up to greet us and take our drink orders. The other downside of the service, they don't place the wine bottles at your table but at a communal table in the centre of the room, they're suppose to pour for you but I found that our server kept forgetting even when our wine glasses were empty. I had to reach over to this communal table to grab our own bottle of wine and pour every time which really kills the experience.\n\nI hope this was just an isolated experience for us as I think this restaurant is a real gem in the Leslieville area. If you do decide to go, make sure you have reservations as the restaurant seems to get filled up in all hours of the night.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

The beef tartar was by far my best course. The scallops were fine, as to be expected. The broccoli Was good once you were able to get past that it was cold.

As I understand it, the polenta to start rotates nightly... maybe weekly? This particular night it was served with some seasoned pork and Parmesan cheese. Thumbs way up for the polenta, the pork on the other hand... eh. Didn't have a tremendous amount of flavor. But no worries. Our entrees were bomb. Fish, filet, sides I don't think you can go wrong, and I highly suggest grabbing things everyone will like because you'll want to start forking at your neighbor's!

I had the scrambled eggs -- smooth and fluffy with pecorino cheese and mixed peppers. It came with a green salad and warm baguette. It was filling without being too heavy or greasy. My DC had the Farmer's Breakfast, with a hard boiled egg in this deep fried batter, with an assortment of Ontario and Quebec cheeses (including a yummy Brie), pate, and tiny pickles. We shared an order of rosti, which was just right -- crisp and hearty. It's chunkier than the rosti at Le Petit Dejeuner, but not as thick as the rosti at Richtree\/Movenpick. For drinks, I just had a glass of the freshly squeezed OJ. They do have $5 mimosas and caesars. DC had coffee, which was refilled diligently. \n\nThe whole meal for 2 people came to $40 including tax and tip. Pretty reasonable for a nice place and great food.

The fried polenta didn't seem \"fried\" as it wasn't crispy; not even around the edges which made the dish mushy...but then again, that's probably why it's called the \"Sloppy\" Guisseppe.
